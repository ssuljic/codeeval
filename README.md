###CodeEval Solutions

These are my submissions to the CodeEval challenges found on [https://www.codeeval.com](https://www.codeeval.com). Most of them are solved with C++ and Ruby, and some of them with C, Go, Java, JavaScript, PHP and Python.

At the time of writing, I'm ranked in the top 100 developers on the CodeEval leaderboard. For more info, progress and stats refer to my public profile: [https://www.codeeval.com/profile/ssuljic/](https://www.codeeval.com/profile/ssuljic/).
